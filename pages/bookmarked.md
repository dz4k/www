### Programming Languages

-	[jq Manual](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/)

	> A jq program is a "filter". It takes an input, and produces an output. There are a lot of builtin filters for extracting a particular field of an object, or converting a number to a string, or various other standard tasks.
	
	A good programming language for the web (client code, server code, compile-to-JS) should look at jq for inspiration. The associative array is the essential data structure of Web applications, and also what a JSON object is.

-	[On callback hell](https://qed-lang.org/qed/update/2018/11/09/on-callback-hell.html) and [A 'new', seamless concurrency model](https://qed-lang.org/article/2019/06/27/coroutines.html)

	Related is the concept of [function color](https://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2015/02/01/what-color-is-your-function/). A conceptually simple solution is proposed.
	
## Cool Software

-	[Margin: Lightweight markup designed for an open mind](https://margin.love/)

	> Margin is a lightweight markup language for hierarchically structured thought, like notes and to-do lists.
	>
	> Its platform-independent structure is both human- and machine-readable.
	
	The sheer simplicity and expressiveness! 
	
-	[Polymath](https://jwmza.com/polymath/)

	> Polymath is a markup language (like Markdown, LaTeX, or HTML) and a static site generator specialized in aesthetically presenting a wide variety of information: text, mathematics, code, photos, videos, you name it.
	
	It's like if LaTeX cheated on Markdown with RTF.
	
-	[Planner on elementary App Store](https://appcenter.elementary.io/com.github.alainm23.planner/)

	> Everyone needs a task manager and Planner adapts to anyone's needs
	
	We love a well-designed FOSS application. I will definitely try it when I eventually move to elementary OS.
	
-	[Search My Site](https://searchmysite.net/)

	A search engine that favors personal websites.

## Design

-	[TfL Line Diagram Standard](http://content.tfl.gov.uk/tfl-line-diagram-standard.pdf)

	It's great to see how the pros do it. 

-	[Tutorial: How To Design a Transit Diagram](https://cambooth.net/how-to-design-a-transit-diagram/)

	Would have been nice if I saw this before starting <ankarametro.denizaksimsek.com>...
