	+	> MetaCtrl apps enable automatic background smart file sync between your Android device and popular cloud storage services: Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive, Dropbox, Box, MEGA, pCloud, Yandex Disk. Their official apps are surprisingly dumb. They have no or very limited automatic sync. Everthing is manual. Our apps are here to fill the gap. Check them out on Google Play Store!

	+	> A modern web application is obviously implemented in JavaScript and will generate its HTML on the client within the browser. It only communicates with the server by retrieving data in a JSON format from an HTTP/REST API endpoint - this, it seems, is the common wisdom of today. But are server-side HTML and progressive enhancement really out of date? Quite the contrary is true - we can use these technologies to create applications which are often much better than those which we could create with the Framework of the Week for creating single page apps.
