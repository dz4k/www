    But the most important thing: Delta Chat allows you to communicate
    even with people who don't use Delta Chat at all, all you need is an
    email address! If you write to someone without Delta Chat, they will
    just get a normal email. I would argue that even beats Matrix or XMPP.

    Conclusion: If you are concerned about security when chatting and
    would rather use a decentralized messenger (no silo), you are in good
    hands with email and Delta Chat.

I am astounded that I didn't know about this app earlier. Just installed it, and will recommend it to friends!
