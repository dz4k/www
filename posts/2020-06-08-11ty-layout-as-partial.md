On this website, I have both a <a href="/notes/">Notes</a> page and pages for each individual note. I wanted to use the same template for both, but I ran into an issue: accessing frontmatter data.

<!-- endexcerpt -->

In Eleventy, frontmatter data for the current page is merged into the [data cascade](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/data-cascade/) and made available on the template global scope, whereas collection items have a `data` property. This made it hard to write templates that work with both the `page` object and collection items.

The solution to my problem was right there in the Eleventy docs, staring at me, its description phrased such that it couldn't possibly be of use to anyone.

[also-getcollectionitem]: https://www.11ty.dev/docs/filters/collection-items/\#also-getcollectionitem

With this filter, all my problems were solved. I prepended the following to my `note.njk` template (similarly for `post.njk`):

{%raw%}
```liquid
{%set item = note | d(collections.note | getCollectionItem(page))%}
```
{%endraw%}

When using `note.njk` as a partial, the caller assigns the variable `note`. When using it as a layout, no such variable will exist and the default (`d()`) will be used.. The beauty of this configuration is that in both situations, `item` will be a collection item with a `data` property.

One caveat is that because I'm using this as a partial, I can't use frontmatter, and therefore can't set a layout for my layout (maybe I could use template data files...). Instead, I use Nunjucks' builtin [template inheritance](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/templating.html#template-inheritance).

{%raw%}
```liquid
{%if not note%}
{%extends "base.njk"%}
{%endif%}
...
{%block content%}
{%set item = note | d(collections.note | getCollectionItem(page))%}
...
{%endblock%}
```
{%endraw%}
