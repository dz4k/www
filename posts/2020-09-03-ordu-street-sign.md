I quite enjoy the font used.

{%img uPhoto, "Old, fading street sign, with text 'Yeniköy Caddesi ↞' and the logo of the Metropolitan Municipality of Ordu."%}

The layout seems inspired by street signs in İstanbul, but those are red and lack a garish logo at the bottom, instead featuring the names and color codes of the districts of İstanbul. I should post a photo if I end up going there for some reason. <ins>Update 06/01/2021: [I did!](https://denizaksimsek.com/2020/istanbul-street-sign/)</ins>
