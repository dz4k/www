### Server-Side App

-	Full-page reloads
-	HTML only has GET and POST methods
-	...and only link clicks & form submissions

### Single-Page App

-	Reinvent the accessible web
-	Need big frameworks or complex code
-	Probably need a server anyway for SSR
-	The client is untrueted

### Progressively Enhanced App

-	Tight coupling between server & client code
-	Behavior is scattered

### htmx

-	Completing HTML with arbitrary events, replacing fragments instead of the whole page
-	Your code runs on the server, which you trust
-	htmx allows for **locality of behavior**

<small>Consult your doctor to find out if htmx s right for you. Side effects may include arguing about REST on HN.</small>

The year is 2040.

htmx is a W3C recommendation and _hyperscript is an ECMA standard.
War has long ceased, API churn is nought but a distant memory.
