```css
a:not([class]) {
  color: currentColor;
}
```

We qualify elements with the `:not` pseudo class because if you have a link that’s supposed to look like a button that has a `.button` class on it, you don’t want global link styling to get in the way of the styling that `.button` generates, so this approach helps that.

.flow > * + * {

You might be thinking, "why the heck is there <mark>no margin?</mark>". That’s because we have [this CSS reset][] loaded in to our HTML.

[...]

```css
p,
li {
  max-width: 60ch;
}

h1 {
  max-width: 15ch;
}

h2,
h3 {
  max-width: 25ch;
}
```
